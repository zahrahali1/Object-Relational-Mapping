# 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## Task

I have created a back end for an e-commerce website using Express.js and Sequelize to interact with a PostgreSQL database. By configuring environment variables for seamless database connection, creating and seeding a development database with test data, and implementing API routes for data retrieval and manipulation, the goal was to equip internet retail companies with the latest technologies, ensuring their competitiveness in the e-commerce market. Additionally, a comprehensive walkthrough video demonstrating the application's functionality was provided, along with its inclusion in the project's README for easy reference.
